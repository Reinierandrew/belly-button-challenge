# Biodiversity Dashboard
In this project I analyse a set of data that represents the bacteria in peoples belly buttons. For this I created a javascript file and within that I used D3 and Plotly to create the results and output as can be seen on the index.html page.

## Steps
In my code I use functions to draw the various charts. These charts change when a new persdo(ID) is selected. 

The barchart is straightforward and shows the top 10 bacteria present in the selected person's (ID)  belly button,

The bubblegraph needa little explanation. This chart shows all the bacteria for the selected person's (ID) where ths size of the bubble is relative to the quantity of the specific bateria found.

I chose to use a fairly simple gauge to represent the washing frequency rather than a complex gauge.

## Conclusions

The quanity and variation of bacteria varies a lot between the people sampled. Further analysis will be required to find any correlations and other relevant statitical data in the dataset used.
